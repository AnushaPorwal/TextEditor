# TextEditor

This is a text editor similar to notepad. It can save, open and edit a file with any extension. You could type out your content, 
change the font, size and emphasis. Other functionalities of the editor were, cut, copy and paste, find, replace and replace all.
We called our text editor Feather nâ€™ Ink Text Editor.

This text editor doesn't save the changes to the font, size and emphasis of the text, just like notepad. But unlike notepad, you can 
change the font, size and emphasis of selected parts, and you can have multiple of these in the same file.
